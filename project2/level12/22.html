<div class="menu"><h1>There is another sky</h1> </div>
<div class="container" style="margin-left:400px;">There is another sky,
Ever serene and fair,
And there is another sunshine,
Though it be darkness there; 
Never mind faded forests, Austin,
Never mind silent fieldsâ€”
Here is a little forest,
Whose leaf is ever green; 
Here is a brighter garden,
Where not a frost has been; 
In its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum:
Prithee, my brother,
Into my garden come! </div>

<div class="container">Imagination is something else I worry about a lot these days. I think it
might be getting lost. Everybody is so bombarded and overloaded with</div>
